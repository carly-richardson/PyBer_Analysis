# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Exploratory analysis on data from a ride-sharing app company
### To help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for under-served neighborhoods.
- Create a summary DataFrame containing the following:
    - The total number of rides, drivers, and fares for each city type.
    - The average fare per ride for each city type.
    - The average fare per driver for each city type.
- Create a multiple line chart that shows the total weekly fares for each type of city.

### Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5

## Results
### Analysis Summary by City Type

- The total number of rides in rural cities is 13 and 5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The total number of drivers in rural cities is approximately 31 and 6.25 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The total fares is rural cities is about 9.25 times lower than urban cities, and 4.5 times lower than suburban cities.
- The average fare per ride and per driver is higher in rural cities than urban and suburban cities.

### Total Fare by City Type

- The total weekly fares are about $2,000 higher in the urban cities than the rural cities.

## Summary
PyBer should strategize ways to increase the number of riders and drivers in rural cities. PyBer should find ways to advertise more to riders in the rural cities. The average fare per ride in rural cities is $34.62. If the number of total rides were the same in rural and suburban cities (625), then the total fares for rural cities would be $21,637.50. They should also market to their drivers that the average fare per driver is significantly higher, in the rural cities than the urban cities, to incentivize more people to drive in the rural cities. The average fare per driver is almost $40 more in the rural cities than the urban cities. PyBer should also think of additional incentives and benefits to offer drivers from the urban cities to drive more in the rural cities. There are approximately 1.5 times more drivers than rides in the urban cities. If PyBer can get some of those drivers from the urban cities to drive in the rural cities, then the drivers and PyBer would make more money.
